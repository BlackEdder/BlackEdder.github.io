Often political viewpoints are talked about in right-left wing context. In reality voters and parties can rarely be aligned in such a simple (2 dimensional) manner and political viewpoints can be aligned according to many different political axes ([multi-axis political model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum#Other_proposed_dimensions). The website [politcalcompass.org](http://www.politicalcompass.org/) argues for at least two axes: economics and social. In this post we explore the effect of these changes.

Above we show the voting history for a political model that assumes two axes. As shown the first past the post voting system results in 2-4 viable political parties. In contrast the proportional representation voting system results in 4 viable parties.

We can also see that the more political axes we assume there are the more sustainable parties proportional voting supports. In contrast, first past the post supports 2 parties almost regardless of the number of axes. You might also notice that the proportional voting on average results in two parties for each political axes.

## Further additions to the model 

I still want to add both parties that can change their viewpoint over time and the possible for new political parties to appear to the model. I think both of those are very important features of a realistic model. After that I can spend one or more posts on looking at the results in more detail.
