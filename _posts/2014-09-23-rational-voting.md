In the [previous post]( {% post_url 2014-09-22-proportional-representation-vs-first-past-post-voting %} ) I gave a quick overview of the long term difference of proportional representation vs first past the post voting systems and I showed that first past the post voting systems result in less viable political parties in the long run. This is the because in first past the post voting only the larger parties have any chance of getting any power. The way I did that in the previous post was a bit of a hack, where I just assumed that this was the case, without any reasoning. Here I will look at why this is indeed the case for any rational voter.

## What does a rational voter want?

<!-- Add figure with number of votes and then with power. Power needs to be normalized

Distance from average political viewpoint given a vote, which vote minimizes this-->
